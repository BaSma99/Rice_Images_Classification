# Rice_Images_Classification

## About the Dataset

There are numerous genetic variants of rice, one of the most extensively produced grain crops in the world. These variations are distinguished from one another by some of their characteristics. Typically, these include characteristics like texture, shape, and color. These characteristics that set different rice types apart allow for the classification and assessment of seed quality. Five types of rice, commonly farmed in Turkey: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag, were employed in this study. The collection contains a total of 75,000 grain photos, with 15,000 of each type. These photos were used to create a second dataset with 106 features, including 12 morphological, 4 shape, and 90 color features.
